0x14. C - Bit manipulation

Bit manipulation in C programming refers to the manipulation and operations performed on individual bits within a data type. It allows you to perform bitwise operations like AND, OR, XOR, shifting, and masking, which can be useful for various tasks such as optimizing code, manipulating flags, and working with hardware interfaces.

1.  Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
2.  Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
3.  Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
